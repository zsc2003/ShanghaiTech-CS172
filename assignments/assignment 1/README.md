 # (Optional) Visualize Data
Before creating your model, You can visualize the dataset by running the following command to know what the data looks like.

By default, we will create two folders named `train_images` and `test_images`, and save hundreds of images. You can skip this step if you don't want to.
```
python crowd_counting.py --num_epoch 1
```


# Training
Please delete the visualization code during training since it is slow.
