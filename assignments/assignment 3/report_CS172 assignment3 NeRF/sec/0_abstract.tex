In this assignment, we implemented the NeRF and its accelerate method to do 3D novel view synthesis. And we tested the methods on our own datasets, and try to merge the different accelerate methods to chase for a better performance. 

And the following tasks were finished.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Task1: Implementation of NeRF accelerate method (TensoRF and NGP)
    \item Task2: Processing of our own $3$ custom dataset and dataloader of it, then test the performance.
    \item Task3: improve the performance by reasonably combining NGP and TensoRF.
\end{itemize}
